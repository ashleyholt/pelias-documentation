Pelias is an open-source geocoder for fast and accurate global search. It takes input text, such as the name of a place, point of interest, or address, and returns a latitude/longitude location on the Earth's surface for that place.

Pelias provides place and address search against several datasets, including NGA’s Geographic Names Database (GNDB), geonames.org, the Who’s On First (WOF) gazetteer, OpenStreetMap, OpenAddresses, and administrative boundary (polygon) data to support search and filtering of results based on geometry types.
